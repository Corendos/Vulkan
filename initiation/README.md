# Initiation

This is a repository used to train on the Vulkan API. It is not supposed to be clean as I'm trying to understand how things should be done.

## Resources
* [Specification (1.1.88)](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1/html/vkspec.html)
* [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-memory-management)
* [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)

## TODO
[ ] Clean the code, it is absolutely terrific right now  
[ ] Improve memory management for the buffers or images (use binary tree to track occupation)
